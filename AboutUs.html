<p>The club culture of NITR added yet another feather to its cap with the birth of the new student chapter of American Institute of 
Chemical Engineers (AIChE) in this semester. One calm Wednesday evening in LA 101, the first orientation-cum-induction programme was 
organized. The event had a turnout of around 30 zealous students who were all enthusiastic of becoming a part of the organization. 
Despite some minor glitches, the evening started at 6:45 pm with the host and Vice President, Rahul Mohanty giving a warm welcome to 
the audience and introducing them the concept and vision of AIChE. AIChE is the worldâ€™s leading organisation for chemical engineering and
its related branches professionals, with more than 50,000 members from over 100 countries. Then Rahul went on to explain about the 
objectives of the chapter to promote the professional development of its members through its programs and to contribute to the development
of chemical engineering and other related branches at NITR. The chapter holds the benefits of project management and project developing 
skills and participating in events like AIChE Chem-E-Car competition and Global Undergraduate Student Video Competition.
He then explained about the various membership benefits like real world experience with the sponsor companies, familiarity with the
interactive tools used by the industry in AIChE e-library powered by Knovel, free memberships and attractive scholarships for winning the
competitions, job search and better career-shaping options etc. The chapter has collaborated with TnP Cell, which provides the members the 
opportunity to communicate with the chemical fraternity all over the globe, thus not only helping them in gaining good jobs and internships
but also the intellectual support from various worldwide technocrats. To know more about AIChE, visit the link http://www.aiche.org/ .
